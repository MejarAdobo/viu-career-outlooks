# shadcn UI Components

This directory contains UI components built using the **shadcn** library. These components are designed to provide a consistent and cohesive look and feel across the application, leveraging the power of TailwindCSS for styling.

## How shadcn Components Work

**shadcn** components are pre-designed UI elements that integrate seamlessly with TailwindCSS. They offer a set of customizable and reusable components that help maintain design consistency and improve development efficiency. Each component is built with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring a great user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Using shadcn Components

To use a shadcn component in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Component**: Import the desired component from the `components/ui` directory. For example, to use a button component, you might import it like this:

   ```tsx
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
   ```

2. **Customize with Props**: Most shadcn components come with a set of props that allow you to customize their appearance and behavior. Refer to the component's documentation or TypeScript interfaces for available props.

3. **Integrate into Your Component**: Use the imported component within your React component. You can pass props to customize its appearance or behavior as needed.

4. **Styling with TailwindCSS**: While shadcn components come with default styles, you can further customize them using TailwindCSS utility classes. This allows you to adapt the components to fit your specific design requirements.

## Finding More Information

For more detailed information about shadcn components, including available components and their usage, you can refer to the official shadcn documentation. Additionally, each component in this directory may have its own README or comments explaining its specific usage and customization options.

By using shadcn components, you can ensure a consistent design language across your application while benefiting from the flexibility and power of TailwindCSS.
